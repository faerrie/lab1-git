Exercise 1: Creating an empty Git repository, first commit

4* We are on branch master no commits were made.

6* We observe that we did not commit anything yet

9* The command git log gave us the information that we
were able to commit and add readme file successfully.

Exercise 2 : Branching

2* The * shows which branch that we are working for example before
switching from master to branch the * sign was before master, but after the 
switch command it changed to *branch-1

4* We observe that we were able to commit and add modification-1.md
file on branch-1.

6* after the git log command, we can now see that we added and committed the files
read.md, result_git_log.jpeg and modification-1.md with the message "Added modification-1.md"

7* we switched back to master branch again, we can now visualize which branch each of the commits were made to.
With merge command we merged both branches to master then deleted the branch-1.

--- only a modification of the file modification-1.md was made since we created that file after switching to branch-1 and as we switched back to master a modification was made.---

Exercise 3 : Undo the last commit

4* With reflog we save the updates made to the branches and saw each update.
